***# ip_geolocation_python***
This project is based on geolocation data which provides approximate location information such as the country, state, city, zip code, latitude/longitude, ISP, area code, and other information.

Just input the IP address and you will be shown the position on a map, coordinates, country, region, city and organization. Pairing of IP address to a geographical location is the method we used to provide geolocation data.

***#Methodology***

• When a user visits a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. The HTTP request is wrapped in an IP packet, so it always includes the sender's IP address.

• As we described above, the web server can use an IP geolocation service to turn the user's IP address into an approximate location.

• IP-based geolocation isn't terribly accurate, but it can at least give a website a clue as to where their users are coming from. The website can use the approximate location to personalize the experience, serve targeted advertisements, or simply understand their user demographics better.

• ARIN(American Registry for Internet Numbers ) Who is database provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration information for IP resources registered with ARIN.

***#PROS***

• Highly targeted audiences</br>
   -Geolocation allows marketers to connect with customers in close physical proximity to
their business, exponentially increasing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.

• Providing a localized feeling</br>
   -IP based geolocation can display the name of a relevant state or country in a website title in order to provide a localized feeling and attract attention.
   
• Targeted advertising</br>
   -IP based geolocation can be used to emphasize a different product to targeted users.
   
• Redirecting visitors to a page in their language</br>
   -You can leverage IP based geolocation to deliver content that is more targeted and relevant.

***#CONS***

• It doesn’t provide accurate location.</br>
    -IP based geolocation services can only provide an approximate measure of geolocation accuracy.
    
• It doesn’t provide approximate location too after activating of VPN.</br>
    -A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, changes your apparent location by sending your traffic through a server in another location. Here's how that works: Your VPN app lets you select a server anywhere in the world where your VPN service has servers.

***#Conclusion***

• We have provided an overview of IP Geolocation applications and methodologies which provides approximate location and so on using IP addresses . For many years people want to location themselves. Current technology enables us to discover the location in milliseconds. With a geolocation API, it is possible to discover the location of website visitors. Online marketing purposes, fraud detection, personalisation are examples of the usage of the API.
