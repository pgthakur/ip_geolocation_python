# ip_geolocation_python
This project is based on geolocation data which provides approximate location information such as the country, state, city, zip code, latitude/longitude, ISP, area code, and other information.

Just input the IP address and you will be shown the position on a map, coordinates, country, region, city and organization. Pairing of IP address to a geographical location is the method we used to provide geolocation data.

#Methodology
• When a user visits a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. The HTTP request is wrapped in an IP packet, so it always includes the sender's IP address.

• As we described above, the web server can use an IP geolocation service to turn the user's IP address into an approximate location.

• IP-based geolocation isn't terribly accurate, but it can at least give a website a clue as to where their users are coming from. The website can use the approximate location to personalize the experience, serve targeted advertisements, or simply understand their user demographics better.

• ARIN(American Registry for Internet Numbers ) Who is database provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration information for IP resources registered with ARIN.
